# WWII Theater Commander - Implementation Progress

## 🎮 Game Development Tasks

### ✅ Initial Setup
- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Set up development environment

### 📁 Core Game Architecture
- [ ] Create main game layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- [ ] Implement game homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Build core game engine (`src/components/game/GameEngine.tsx`)
- [ ] Develop game renderer with Canvas 2D (`src/components/game/GameRenderer.tsx`)
- [ ] Create game UI and HUD (`src/components/game/GameUI.tsx`)

### 🪖 Entity System Implementation
- [ ] Base Unit class (`src/components/game/entities/Unit.tsx`)
- [ ] Player units (Allied forces) (`src/components/game/entities/PlayerUnits.tsx`)
- [ ] Enemy units (Axis forces) (`src/components/game/entities/EnemyUnits.tsx`)
- [ ] Buildings and objectives (`src/components/game/entities/Buildings.tsx`)

### ⚙️ Game Systems
- [ ] Combat system with realistic damage (`src/components/game/systems/CombatSystem.tsx`)
- [ ] AI system for enemy behavior (`src/components/game/systems/AISystem.tsx`)
- [ ] Resource management system (`src/components/game/systems/ResourceSystem.tsx`)
- [ ] Objective and victory conditions (`src/components/game/systems/ObjectiveSystem.tsx`)

### 🎵 Audio & Effects
- [ ] Audio manager with WWII sound effects (`src/components/game/audio/AudioManager.tsx`)

### 🎯 Game States
- [ ] Menu state management (`src/components/game/states/MenuState.tsx`)
- [ ] Active gameplay state (`src/components/game/states/GameState.tsx`)
- [ ] Mission briefings (`src/components/game/states/BriefingState.tsx`)
- [ ] Victory/defeat screens (`src/components/game/states/VictoryState.tsx`)

### 🔧 Build & Testing
- [ ] Install dependencies (`pnpm install`)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] Build application (`pnpm run build --no-lint`)
- [ ] Start production server (`pnpm start`)
- [ ] API testing with curl (validate game endpoints)
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (desktop/tablet controls)
- [ ] Performance validation (60fps with 40+ units)

### 🚀 Final Deployment
- [ ] Get preview URL
- [ ] Final game testing and polish
- [ ] Documentation completion

## 🎖️ Historical WWII Features
- [ ] Authentic unit designs (Sherman, Panzer IV, T-34)
- [ ] Historical scenarios (Normandy, Stalingrad, Berlin)
- [ ] Period-appropriate sound effects and music
- [ ] Military-themed UI with stencil typography
- [ ] Progressive campaign with historical accuracy

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Mechanics
- [ ] Real-time strategy combat system
